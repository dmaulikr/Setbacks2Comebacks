'His friends called it his 'melancholy.' Lincoln often wept in public and recited sad poetry. He told jokes and stories at odd timesÑhe needed the laughs, he said, for his survival. As a young man he talked often of suicide, and as he grew older he said he saw the world as hard and grim, full of misery, made that way by fate and the forces of God. 'No element of Mr. Lincoln's character,' declared his colleague Henry Whitney, 'was so marked, obvious and ingrained as his mysterious and profound melancholy.' His law partner William Herndon said, 'His melancholy dripped from him as he walked.'
When Lincoln was in his 20s, one of his female friends  whom he had feelings for died due to illness. Lincoln 'told Me that he felt like Committing Suicide often,' remembered Mentor Graham, a schoolteacher, and his neighbors mobilized to keep him safe. One friend recalled, 'Mr Lincolns friends É were Compelled to keep watch [...] over Mr Lincoln, he being from the sudden shock somewhat temporarily deranged. We watched during stormsÑfogsÑdamp gloomy weather É for fear of an accident.' Some villagers worried that he'd end up insane.
Here's a poem from Abraham Lincoln: 'To ease me of this power to think,
       That through my bosom raves,
I'll headlong leap from hell's high brink
       And wallow in its waves.'
Lincoln, too, connected his mental well-being to divine forces. As a young man he saw how religion could ameliorate life's blows, even as he found the consolation of faith elusive. An infidelÑa dissenter from orthodox ChristianityÑhe resisted popular dogma. But many of history's greatest believers have also been its fiercest doubters. Lincoln charted his own theological course to a living vision of how frail, imperfect mortals could turn their suffering selves to the service of something greater and find solaceÑnot in any personal satisfaction or glory but in dutiful mission.'
