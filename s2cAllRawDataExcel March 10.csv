Abraham Lincoln,2/12/1809,"Depression, Recurrent Depression, Suicidal Thoughts","Hodgenville, KY","His friends called it his ""melancholy."" Lincoln often wept in public and recited sad poetry. He told jokes and stories at odd timesÑhe needed the laughs, he said, for his survival. As a young man he talked often of suicide, and as he grew older he said he saw the world as hard and grim, full of misery, made that way by fate and the forces of God. ""No element of Mr. Lincoln's character,"" declared his colleague Henry Whitney, ""was so marked, obvious and ingrained as his mysterious and profound melancholy."" His law partner William Herndon said, ""His melancholy dripped from him as he walked.""When Lincoln was in his 20s, one of his female friends  whom he had feelings for died due to illness. Lincoln ""told Me that he felt like Committing Suicide often,"" remembered Mentor Graham, a schoolteacher, and his neighbors mobilized to keep him safe. One friend recalled, ""Mr Lincolns friends É were Compelled to keep watch [...] over Mr Lincoln, he being from the sudden shock somewhat temporarily deranged. We watched during stormsÑfogsÑdamp gloomy weather É for fear of an accident."" Some villagers worried that he'd end up insane.Here's a poem from Abraham Lincoln: 'To ease me of this power to think,       That through my bosom raves,I'll headlong leap from hell's high brink       And wallow in its waves.'Lincoln, too, connected his mental well-being to divine forces. As a young man he saw how religion could ameliorate life's blows, even as he found the consolation of faith elusive. An infidelÑa dissenter from orthodox ChristianityÑhe resisted popular dogma. But many of history's greatest believers have also been its fiercest doubters. Lincoln charted his own theological course to a living vision of how frail, imperfect mortals could turn their suffering selves to the service of something greater and find solaceÑnot in any personal satisfaction or glory but in dutiful mission.",,http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincolns-great-depression/304247/
Albert Einstein,3/14/1879,"Slow Learner, Late Bloomer, Possible Asperger's Syndrome, Unsociableness, Rejected from Entrance Exam","Ulm, Germany","Einstein was not able to speak until he was 4 years old and his teachers said ""he would never amount to much"". EinsteinÕs parents wanted him to pursue a career in electrical engineering. Without a high school diploma, Einstein applied to the Polytechnic Institute at Zurich, Switzerland and failed the entrance examination although he got exceptional marks in the mathematics and physics sections. Einstein described himself as Òa conscientious but unassuming young man who had acquired his meagre store of pertinent knowledge of the essentials through self study."" Einstein basically taught himself math and physics through books and self-study and skipped lectures and stopped going to classes that didn't interest him. When he was working on the Theory of Relativity, he was working as an Assistant Examiner at a patent office. And then of course, he became one of the greatest scientists of all time. ","ÒThe more I learn, the more I realize [how much] I donÕt know.Ó ÒThe only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.Ó   ÒI owe more to my ability to fantasize than to any knowledge IÕve ever acquired.Ó ÒExample isnÕt another way to teach, it is the only way to teach.Ó ÒIt is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.Ó ÒIf you want your children to be brilliant, tell them fairy tales. If you want them to be very brilliant, tell them even more fairy tales.Ó ÒImagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.Ó ÒWhy should I fill my head with things like that when I could look them up in any reference book in two minutes?Ó ÒIt is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedomÉ.It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.ÓÒThe problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesn't know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God. We see the universe marvelously arranged and obeying certain laws but only dimly understand these laws.Ó",http://www.famoushomeschoolers.net/bio_einstein.html#.WGLgw7YrLBI

David Ogilvy,6/23/11,"Dropped out of college, No Formal Education, Late Bloomer, Career Hopping During Youth",,"His own setback to comeback story is best summarized in his own words that he left us near his retirement. In his note to one of his partners, he said 'Will Any Agency Hire This Man?He is 38, and unemployed. He dropped out of college. He has been a cook, a salesman, a diplomatist and a farmer. He knows nothing about marketing and had never written any copy. He professes to be interested in advertising as a career (at the age of 38!) and is ready to go to work for $5,000 a year.I doubt if any American agency will hire him.However, a London agency did hire him. Three years later he became the most famous copywriter in the world, and in due course built the tenth biggest agency in the world.The moral: it sometimes pays an agency to be imaginative and unorthodox in hiring.'",,http://www.ogilvy.com/About/Our-History/David-Ogilvy-Bio.aspx

Isaac Newton,1/4/1643,"Depression, Bipolar, Introverted, Social Avoidance",England,"English Physicist,  Mathematician, Philosopher and one of the most influential scientists of all time. Famous for his work on Gravity, Laws of Motion (Inertia, Acceleration, Action-Reaction) and Calculus. It is said he was solitary and manic-depressive as a child, didn't engage with other children and  spent most his time alone building miniature mills, machines, carts and other inventions. In college years, he only made one friend and his notebooks document low self-esteem, anxiety, sadness, fear and suicidal thoughts. It is said he often avoided company of others and was extremely disagreeable with others who disagreed with him. In his notes on religion and alchemy, he wrote that he was appointed by God to bring his Truth to the world","To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.This most beautiful system of the sun, planets and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.",https://futurism.com/the-madness-of-sir-isaac-newton/
Jesus Christ,4-6 BCE," Suicidal Thoughts, Betrayal, Falsely Accused, Slandered, Persecuted, Early Death","Bethlehem, Palestine","Jesus Christ was a Jewish carpenter who grew up in Nazareth, which was then a rural town in present-day Israel. What seems to be telling about his mental state is that in The Temptation of Christ in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, Jesus talked about suicide. According to these texts, after being baptized by John the Baptist at age 30, Jesus fasted and prayed for 40 days and nights in the Judaean Desert. During this time, Satan appeared to Jesus and tried to whisper in his ears to jump off a cliff. Not sure if he was hallucinating due to pushing himself to such harsh physical limits through extreme fasting but it is incredibly interesting to know that even Jesus Christ had suicidal thoughts and nasty voices whispering in his ear, like many of us. Jesus was then of course famously betrayed by one of his disciples, Judas, and unjustly crucified on the cross by those who persecuted him for blasphemy and accused him of spreading false messages and pretending to be a false king of the Jews. Jesus was only 33 years old at the time of his death.Jesus is an extremely unique case because he died a very early death compared to all the other great figures of history. And yet, we sing of his name 2000 years after his death and 2.2 billion people around the world (33% of all population) identify themselves as Followers of Jesus's teachings. Near his death, Jesus famously proclaimed ""I have overcome the world"". And Indeed he did. His enemies were probably hoping to shut him up by killing him and to get rid of this religious following that Jesus started. Instead, through his Disciples who dedicated their lives to spreading his teachings, Jesus outlived and defeated his enemies, not through violence or battle, but through patience, education, truth and love. And that's why Jesus Christ is one of the greatest setbacks to comeback stories of all time.",,

Joseph,,"Betrayal, Falsely Accused, Slavery ",Canaan,"The story of Joseph is found in the Book of Genesis in the Torah & Bible. His life was a series of highs and lows. He was the most favored son and most loved by his father, Jacob, among his 10 brothers. Not only that, he was talented at interpreting dreams and prophesized that one day he will rule over his family. His life took a major downturn when his jealous brothers captured him and sold him into slavery at Egypt, faking his death. As a slave, his intelligence and talent quickly promoted him as head of all the slaves but at one point, his owner's wife tried to seduce him and then accused him of rape which got him thrown out. After years in slavery and prison cells, he eventually gained audience with the Pharaoh of Egypt by interpreting his dreams and predicting that a great famine was to come. The Pharaoh was impressed with him and made Joseph into a Vizier, second-in-command of all of Egypt.  Joseph's brothers, 20 years after selling Joseph to slavery, went down to Egypt after suffering from famine, and met Joseph who was now very powerful. Joseph forgave his brothers and brougth the entire family down to Egypt. Joseph lives until 110 years old, and his will was for the Jews to take his remains with them when they finally leave Egypt. Moses fulfills his wills by carrying Joseph's bones on the way to Israel.",,http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-story-of-joseph/

Leonardo Da Vinci,4/14/1452,Lack of Formal Education,"Anciano, Italy","A Renaissance Polymath, Artist, Architect, Engineer, Inventor, Writer, Musician, Scientist. One of the greatest painters of all time. Credited with invention of helicopter, parachutes and tank. And of course drew The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. His personality was considered to be ""mysterious and remote"".","Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death.Learning never exhausts the mind.Iron rusts from disuse; stagnant water loses its purity and in cold weather becomes frozen; even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind.It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.ÒI love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. ÔTis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death.ÓÊ",

Michelangelo,3/6/1475," Possible OCD, Possible Autism, Possible Asperger, Mood Disorders","Florence, Italy","Artist, Painter, Sculptor, Designer and Poet. Michelangelo was considered the greatest living artist of his time for painting, sculpture and architecture, famous for his work like the ""Statue of David"" and The Sistine Chapel ceiling.According to records, the painter was described as often paranoid, narcisstic and schizoid,  Òpreoccupied with his own reality"" and most of the male members of his family are recorded to have exhibited similar symptoms, which might point to some genetic causes for both his brilliance and menetal disposition. Michelangelo also seems to have had difficulty forming relationships with people; he had few friends, was a loner and preferred to work independently. All of this, combined with his obvious genius in math and art, led the researchers to believe that today Michelangelo would be considered high functioning on the autism spectrum. When he was 30, he is quoted to have written, ÔAnything might happen to shatter my world.Õ","If people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all.I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.Genius is eternal patience.The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.A man paints with his brains and not with his hands.The true work of art is but a shadow of the divine perfection.Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle.",http://www.news-medical.net/news/2004/05/26/1931.aspx

He said his own success was due to perseverance, not genius.","Every man if he so desires becomes scultor of his own brain. All great work is the fruit of patience and perseverance, combined with tenacious concentration on a subject over a period of months or years.To know the brain is equivalent to ascertaining the material course of thought and will, to discovering the intimate history of life in its perpetual duel with  external forcesIt is idle to dispute with old men. Their opinions, like their cranial sutures, are ossified.I would be the last to deny that the greatest scientific pioneers belonged to an aristocracy of the spirit and were exceptionally intelligent, something that we as modest investigators will never attain, no matter how much we exert ourselves. Nevertheless É I continue to believe that there is always room for anyone with average intelligence É to utilize his energy and É any man could, if he were so inclined, be the sculptor of his own brain, and that even the least gifted may, like the poorest land that has been well-cultivated and fertilized, produce an abundant harvest.It is notorious that the desire to live increases as life itself shortens.",http://www.azquotes.com/
