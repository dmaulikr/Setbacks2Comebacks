# Setbacks2Comebacks

Swift 3.0 iOS app is a compilation of historical greats and living greats with timeless stories who have made their setbacks into comebacks, tests into testimonies.
My motivation for making this app is to help remind all of us that setbacks, mental disorders, weaknesses and vulnerabilities are a necessity and an integral part of what makes people great, not an exception.

If you are suffering through depression, bipolar disorder, failed relationship, failed career opportunity, suicidal thoughts, or anything else that seems to be holding you back in life,
I would love it if you could read through some of the biographies and setback stories of these people in this app. 

I hope that their story reaches you and serves as a small candle of light for your journey.
These people are proof that whatever setback you are experiencing might be the catalyst for the greatest comeback of your entire life. 

By the way, doesn't it seem like some of the smartest people in the world had depression and bipolar? ;) 

Here's the list of people. 

* Newton (Depression, Bipolar)
