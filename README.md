# Setbacks2Comebacks

This app is a Swift 3.0 iOS app that offers a list of historical greats and living greats with timeless stories who have made their life setbacks into comebacks, tests into testimonies. Anybody can contribute! 

My motivation for making this app is to help remind all of us that setbacks, mental illnesses, weaknesses and vulnerabilities are a necessity and an integral part of what makes us great, not an exception or something to be ashamed of or dejected by. 

If you are suffering through depression, mental disorder, failed relationship, failed career opportunity, suicidal thoughts, or anything else that's making you miserable and unable to feel happy and confident in your current life, please read through some of the biographies and setback stories of these people that I list in this app.

These people went through it too. 
They are proof that whatever setback you are experiencing ... might end up becoming the catalyst for the greatest comeback of your entire life. 
In fact, you will see that greater the Setback, more powerful and inspiring their comeback.  

Remember, "Every great Comeback story starts with a Setback."
I hope their stories reach you and serves as a small candle of light for your journey.
