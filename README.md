# Setbacks2Comebacks

Swift 3.0 iOS app is a compilation of historical greats and living greats with timeless stories who have made their setbacks into comebacks, tests into testimonies.

My motivation for making this app is to help remind all of us that setbacks, mental disorders, weaknesses and vulnerabilities are a necessity and an integral part of what makes people great, not an exception.

If you are suffering through depression, mental disorder, failed relationship, failed career opportunity, suicidal thoughts, or anything else that's making you miserable and unable to feel happy and confident in your life, please read through some of the biographies and setback stories of these people that I list in this app.

These people are proof that whatever setback you are experiencing ... might end up becoming the catalyst for the greatest comeback of your entire life. 

Remember, "Every great Comeback story starts with a Setback". 
I hope that their stories reach you and serves as a small candle of light for your journey.

Here's the list of people.
